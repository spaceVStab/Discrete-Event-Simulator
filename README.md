# Discrete-Event-Simulator
Discrete Event Simulator for application in Reinforcement Learning
<br/>
<br/>
There are not many simulators which provide event based simulation control. For my B.Tech project based in application of RL in discrete event scheduling a simulator was required. These codes suffices just for the basics required for a proto-type RL model.

`Added Features`
- For fixed number of jobs and fixed number of machines, with ordering constraint among the jobs
- Naive Q learning algorithm 
- Deep Q Network added but many issues training it

`TODO`
- Provide an interface for gym
- Add functionality for continuous pool of jobs with fix number of machines
- Fix issues around DQN
